# Organized parking system using machine learning
The proposed organized parking system to apply machine learning is all about having a seamless and 
effective parking experience. The system will employ various machine learning techniques in parking 
space optimization, entry, and exit streamlining, and general management. It will tap into sensors and 
cameras to collect real-time information on available parking slots, types of cars, and traffic flows in 
the parking facility. Machine learning algorithms would then analyze such data to make predictions 
about parking demand patterns, identify the best-fit parking spot for incoming vehicles on the basis 
of size and proximity to exits or entrances, and keep changing prices to incentivize optimal use of 
space. The system could also be embedded with a predictive maintenance algorithm, thus predicting 
and avoiding possible equipment failures in real time, and thereby ensuring that the operation is never 
interrupted. The organized parking system involves machine learning in order to provide maximum 
comfort to the driver, better space utilization for the operator, and reduced congestion on the roads of 
a city.
